# SPORTS VIDYA INVESTOR PITCH - NOTEBOOKLM SCRIPT (COMPANY-FOCUSED)

## IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:
This is about a SPECIFIC COMPANY called "Sports Vidya" (website: https://sportsvidya.com), founded by Viresh Agrawal. Every discussion must reference this company by name, mention the founder, and present Sports Vidya as THE solution to India's sports ecosystem problems. This is NOT a general discussion about sports platforms - it's specifically about Sports Vidya's fundraising pitch.

---

## OPENING (Must mention company immediately)

**Host 1:** "Welcome everyone! Today we're diving into an incredibly exciting investment opportunity - a company called Sports Vidya, founded by Viresh Agrawal. This is India's first comprehensive sports ecosystem platform, and they're currently raising ₹8-10 crore to scale their operations."

**Host 2:** "Sports Vidya - that's S-P-O-R-T-S V-I-D-Y-A dot com, right? I've heard about this. They're basically creating what India's sports industry has desperately needed for decades."

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Sports Vidya is positioned as 'The Sports Super App' - and here's what makes this so compelling. Viresh Agrawal, the founder, identified a massive problem that's been holding India back from becoming a global sporting powerhouse..."

---

## THE PROBLEM (Set up Sports Vidya as the answer)

**Host 2:** "Let me paint the picture of what Viresh saw when he founded Sports Vidya. India has 1.4 billion people - that's nearly 20% of the world's population. Yet at the Olympics, China wins 80+ medals while India wins only 5 or 6. We rank 71st in medals per capita. Why?"

**Host 1:** "And this is exactly what drove Viresh Agrawal to create Sports Vidya. He realized the problem isn't lack of talent - it's a completely fragmented and broken ecosystem. Let me give you the specifics that Sports Vidya's pitch deck highlights..."

**Host 2:** "Go ahead."

**Host 1:** "Right now, if you're a talented young athlete in India, you have to coordinate with 15 different service providers. You need a coach - that's one vendor. Then you need specialized nutrition - that's another. Sports psychology? Another vendor. Physiotherapy? Equipment? Online education so you don't have to drop out of school? Each one requires separate research, vetting, contracts, and payments."

**Host 2:** "That's exhausting. And I'm guessing most families just can't manage that complexity?"

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Sports Vidya's research shows that 80% of young athletes in India quit by age 16 because they're forced to choose between education and sports. There's no integrated solution - until Sports Vidya came along."

**Host 2:** "So what specifically did Viresh Agrawal see that others didn't?"

**Host 1:** "Well, Viresh is a passionate sports enthusiast himself, and he experienced these pain points firsthand. He saw that Arjun Award winners - that's India's highest sporting honor - are earning just ₹25,000 per month. Dronacharya Award-winning coaches, the best in the country, are being paid less than entry-level software engineers."

**Host 2:** "That's shocking!"

**Host 1:** "And it gets worse. According to Sports Vidya's market analysis, 30-40% of sports equipment sold in India is fake or counterfeit. The government has invested ₹15,000 crore in sports infrastructure, but most of it is poorly maintained and underutilized. The entire system is broken at every level."

---

## THE SOLUTION (Sports Vidya is THE answer - mention repeatedly)

**Host 2:** "Okay, so that's where Sports Vidya comes in. How exactly is Viresh Agrawal and his team solving this?"

**Host 1:** "This is where it gets really exciting. Sports Vidya - and you can check this out at sportsvidya.com - has built the world's first truly integrated sports ecosystem platform. Think of it like this: Sports Vidya is to athlete development what Amazon is to shopping, or what Uber is to transportation."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya aggregates all these services?"

**Host 1:** "Not just aggregates - Sports Vidya carefully curates and integrates 16+ essential services that every athlete needs. Let me walk through what Sports Vidya offers on their platform..."

**Host 2:** "Please do."

**Host 1:** "First, Sports Vidya partners with companies like Map My Genome and Lami.ft to offer DNA testing. This tells athletes which sport suits their genetic makeup, what nutrition they need, and what injury risks they have."

**Host 2:** "DNA testing for sports? That's cutting-edge!"

**Host 1:** "It is! And Sports Vidya is the only platform in India integrating this at scale. Second, Sports Vidya has partnered with TATA ClassEdge - yes, the Tata Group - to provide online education from Class 1 to 12. This means Sports Vidya athletes can continue their academics while training."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya is solving that education versus sports conflict?"

**Host 1:** "Completely solving it! That's what makes Sports Vidya unique. Third, Sports Vidya provides sports psychology through their partner Nudge Sports, professional physiotherapy through TryAmp, customized nutrition plans through Noor Kesar..."

**Host 2:** "Wait, how many services does Sports Vidya integrate?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya integrates 16+ services! They have coaching through 50+ verified academies - including ones run by Arjun and Dronacharya Award winners. They have equipment sales through Khelmart - and Sports Vidya guarantees 100% authentic products, no fakes. They have crowdfunding through Saanjha, live streaming through SportVot, career guidance through Mad About Sports..."

**Host 2:** "This is comprehensive! So if I'm a parent with a talented 12-year-old, I just go to sportsvidya.com and..."

**Host 1:** "Exactly! You go to sportsvidya.com or download the Sports Vidya app, and you get access to everything. Sports Vidya even offers free consultations with sports experts to assess your child's needs and create a customized plan."

---

## HOW SPORTS VIDYA WORKS (User journey)

**Host 2:** "Walk me through how Sports Vidya actually works in practice."

**Host 1:** "Sure! Let's say you're the parent of a 13-year-old named Priya who shows talent in running. You visit sportsvidya.com and book a free consultation. A Sports Vidya expert assesses Priya's potential, current level, and family budget."

**Host 2:** "Okay, so Sports Vidya starts with personalized consultation."

**Host 1:** "Right. Then Sports Vidya recommends a DNA test through their partners. This costs ₹15,000-25,000 and reveals which athletic events suit Priya's genetics best - maybe she's built for sprints rather than marathons. The DNA test also tells Sports Vidya's nutritionists exactly what diet Priya needs."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya uses actual genetic science?"

**Host 1:** "Yes! Sports Vidya then creates a complete development plan. They match Priya with a verified athletics coach from their network of 50+ academies. They enroll her in TATA ClassEdge through Sports Vidya so she continues her education online. They set up physiotherapy sessions through Sports Vidya's partner TryAmp. They provide DNA-based nutrition plans. Sports Vidya even helps set up a crowdfunding campaign if the family needs financial support."

**Host 2:** "And all of this is managed through Sports Vidya's single platform?"

**Host 1:** "Exactly! One login, one app, one coordinated journey. Sports Vidya handles the complexity. That's what Viresh Agrawal built - a true super app for sports."

---

## SPORTS VIDYA'S TRACTION (Prove it's working)

**Host 2:** "Okay, this sounds amazing in theory. But is Sports Vidya actually working? What's the traction?"

**Host 1:** "The numbers are impressive. Sports Vidya has achieved 96% customer retention. Think about that - 96% of people who use Sports Vidya stick with the platform."

**Host 2:** "That's incredible! Industry average is what, 20-30% for apps?"

**Host 1:** "Exactly. Sports Vidya also has over 100 positive reviews from athletes, parents, and coaches. But here's what really validates Sports Vidya's model - the average user consumes 3.2 services from their platform."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya users aren't just buying one thing - they're using multiple services?"

**Host 1:** "Yes! That proves Sports Vidya's integration works. People trust Sports Vidya enough to use them for coaching AND education AND equipment AND psychology. And 40% of Sports Vidya's new users come from referrals - pure word of mouth."

**Host 2:** "What partnerships has Sports Vidya secured?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya has partnerships with major brands - TATA ClassEdge for education, Map My Genome for DNA testing, Khelmart for equipment, companies like COSCO, Yonex, and Patanjali. Sports Vidya has also built relationships with 50+ sports academies across India, including those run by India's most decorated athletes and coaches."

---

## SPORTS VIDYA'S BUSINESS MODEL (How they make money)

**Host 2:** "How does Sports Vidya make money from all this?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya has a smart, diversified revenue model. First, they earn commissions when users book services through their platform - typically 10-20% of the transaction value. So if someone books a ₹25,000 DNA test through Sports Vidya, the company earns ₹3,750."

**Host 2:** "And Sports Vidya doesn't have to actually provide the service?"

**Host 1:** "Correct! Sports Vidya is asset-light. They partner with the best service providers and earn a commission for connecting them with verified customers. This gives Sports Vidya gross margins of 70%+."

**Host 2:** "That's a beautiful model. What else?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya also earns revenue from e-commerce - when people buy equipment through the Sports Vidya platform. Third, Sports Vidya is building a SaaS business - subscription software for academies to manage their students, and premium features for athletes. Fourth, Sports Vidya has advertising and sponsorship revenue."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya has four different revenue streams?"

**Host 1:** "Yes! And here's the unit economics Sports Vidya shared in their pitch: For that ₹25,000 DNA test, Sports Vidya earns ₹3,750 in commission, spends ₹800 on customer acquisition, and ₹250 on operating costs. That's ₹2,700 net profit per transaction - a 72% margin!"

**Host 2:** "And customers use multiple services, so Sports Vidya's lifetime value must be high."

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Sports Vidya calculates customer lifetime value at ₹8,000-12,000, with customer acquisition cost of just ₹800. That's a 10-15x return."

---

## THE MARKET OPPORTUNITY (Why Sports Vidya can be huge)

**Host 2:** "How big can Sports Vidya actually get?"

**Host 1:** "The numbers are staggering. Sports Vidya is targeting a ₹72,000 crore market in India that's growing at 14% annually. That includes sports equipment, education, wellness, infrastructure services, and digital content."

**Host 2:** "₹72,000 crore - that's nearly $10 billion!"

**Host 1:** "Yes! And Sports Vidya isn't just playing in one category. They're aggregating multiple fragmented markets. Sports Vidya's addressable market includes 15 million aspiring young athletes, 25 million households with sports-active children, and 5 million current amateur and semi-professional athletes."

**Host 2:** "Why is now the right time for Sports Vidya?"

**Host 1:** "Three major tailwinds for Sports Vidya: First, the Indian government just launched Khelo India with a ₹3,165 crore budget, specifically aiming to make India a top-10 Olympic nation by 2028. Second, middle-class parents are spending 25% more year-over-year on children's sports. Third, 750 million smartphone users in India make Sports Vidya's digital platform accessible everywhere."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya is perfectly positioned for this moment."

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Viresh Agrawal founded Sports Vidya at exactly the right time when all these factors are converging."

---

## WHY SPORTS VIDYA WINS (Competitive advantages)

**Host 2:** "What stops someone else from copying Sports Vidya?"

**Host 1:** "Great question! Sports Vidya has several strong moats. First, they're the first mover - Sports Vidya is literally creating the 'integrated sports development platform' category. There's no direct competitor doing what Sports Vidya does."

**Host 2:** "But couldn't a big company like Byju's or Zomato enter this space?"

**Host 1:** "They could try, but Sports Vidya has a 2-3 year head start. Here's what makes Sports Vidya defensible: It took Viresh Agrawal and his team over two years to build relationships with 50+ academies and 15+ premium service partners. Sports Vidya has exclusive partnerships with some of these providers."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya's network is the moat?"

**Host 1:** "That's one moat. Second, Sports Vidya has a unique education integration with TATA ClassEdge. No other sports platform offers this, and it solves the #1 reason kids quit sports. Third, Sports Vidya has network effects - the more athletes join Sports Vidya, the more service providers want to partner with Sports Vidya, which attracts more athletes."

**Host 2:** "What about Sports Vidya's DNA-first approach?"

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Sports Vidya is building India's largest genetic database for sports through their DNA testing partnerships. This data helps Sports Vidya make better recommendations and becomes more valuable over time. Competitors can't replicate this data."

---

## SPORTS VIDYA'S FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS

**Host 2:** "Let's talk numbers. What's Sports Vidya projecting?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya has conservative but impressive projections. Year 1: Sports Vidya expects 50,000 users, ₹8-12 crore revenue, with a small loss as they invest in growth."

**Host 2:** "That seems reasonable for Sports Vidya's current stage."

**Host 1:** "Year 2: Sports Vidya projects 200,000 users - that's 4x growth - with ₹35-45 crore revenue and ₹3-5 crore profit. Year 3: Sports Vidya expects 500,000 users, ₹100-130 crore revenue, and ₹18-25 crore profit."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya becomes profitable in Year 2?"

**Host 1:** "Yes! The unit economics are that strong. By Year 5, Sports Vidya projects 2.5 million users, ₹550-700 crore revenue, and ₹165-230 crore profit."

**Host 2:** "Those are ambitious numbers. What assumptions is Sports Vidya making?"

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya assumes 30% of users convert to paying customers - which is conservative given their current 40%+ conversion. Sports Vidya also assumes ₹6,000-8,000 average transaction value and 30% year-over-year growth. These are all conservative based on Sports Vidya's current performance."

---

## THE FOUNDER - VIRESH AGRAWAL

**Host 2:** "Let's talk about the founder. Who is Viresh Agrawal and why is he the right person to build Sports Vidya?"

**Host 1:** "Viresh Agrawal is a passionate sports enthusiast who lived these problems firsthand. When Viresh was growing up in Jharkhand, he experienced the fragmentation - having to travel 200km to find a decent coach, watching talented friends quit due to academic pressure, seeing coaches barely scraping by financially."

**Host 2:** "So Sports Vidya comes from personal experience?"

**Host 1:** "Absolutely! Viresh Agrawal spent years in the sports industry building relationships. That's how Sports Vidya was able to partner with Arjun and Dronacharya Award winners - Viresh has deep, personal connections with India's sporting elite."

**Host 2:** "What's Viresh's vision for Sports Vidya?"

**Host 1:** "Viresh Agrawal's vision is bold: He wants Sports Vidya to help India become a top-10 Olympic nation by 2028. Viresh wants 50+ Sports Vidya athletes competing at the 2028 Olympics and 10-15 medals won by athletes who used the Sports Vidya platform."

**Host 2:** "That's not just a business vision - that's a national mission!"

**Host 1:** "Exactly! Viresh Agrawal always says that Sports Vidya isn't just building a startup - they're building India's sporting future. And that passion comes through when you talk to the Sports Vidya team."

**Host 1:** "Sports Vidya expects 200,000 users, 50+ partnerships, break-even unit economics, and expansion to 10+ states. By 18 months, Sports Vidya projects 500,000 users, they'll launch their B2B SaaS product, achieve operational profitability, and be Series A ready."

How many coaches are earning fair wages through the Sports Vidya platform? How many underprivileged athletes are getting access through Sports Vidya?"

**Host 2:** "This is inspiring. Sports Vidya is building a movement, not just a business."
